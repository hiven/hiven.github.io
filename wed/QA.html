                                    <li><span class="question">What should I wear?</span>
                     We hope our wedding will offer you a good excuse to dress up! Mostly we want our guests to be comfortable so we do not expect you in your formal black tie, think late summer garden party. Our ceremony will be outdoors (Great British weather permitting...) so please bear in mind there are lots of grassy areas, as well as stone chippings - so perhaps best to avoid stilettos!

                     <span class="question">What facilities are on-site?</span>
                     If you are staying in the tents, there are permanent shower and toilet blocks for you to use. The rooms in the house and barns are all en suite (some have a bath too!)

                  <li>
                     <span class="question">What do I need to bring with me?</span>
                     The usual bits, plus a swim costume, Hawaiian shirt and something to drink on Friday. For those in tents, a bed will be setup with bedding and pillows. However, you will need to bring a towel.

                     <span class="question">Can I park my car on site?</span>

                  </li>
                  <li><span class="question">How do I get around the local area?</span>
                     Uber unfortunately hasn’t reached Anran yet, but we have been recommended the following local taxi companies: 
                     X
                     X
                     X
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="question">Where will my room/tent be?</span>
                     You can expect an email two weeks before the wedding giving you all the details on your accommodation - watch this space!
