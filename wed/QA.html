                  <li><span class="question">Help - I don’t know what to wear!?</span>
                     We hope our wedding will offer you a good excuse to dress up! Mostly we want our guests to be comfortable so we do not expect you in your formal black tie. Think late summer garden party! Our ceremony will be outdoors (Great British weather permitting..), so please bear in mind there are lots of grassy areas, as well as stone chippings - so perhaps best to avoid stilettos!
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="question">I’m not staying on site - what’s the best way to get to and from the venue?</span>
                     Uber unfortunately hasn’t reached Anran yet, but we have been recommended the following local taxi companies: 
                     X
                     X
                     X
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="question">I’m staying on site - where will my room/tent be?</span>
                     You can expect an email two weeks before the wedding giving you all the details on your accommodation - watch this space!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="question">Can I park my car on site?</span>
                     Yes! Plenty of parking is available, however we do encourage sharing cars where possible to limit our environmental impact. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="question">What’s the situation with the bar - does your venue take card or should I bring cash?</span>
                     Leave your wallets behind friends, and strap yourselves in for an open bar! Yes, you read that right. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="question">What do I need to bring with me?</span>
                     Mostly your party faces and dancing shoes! On a more serious note, bedding is provided no matter what accommodation you have booked. If you are staying in a tent, please bring a towel with you.
