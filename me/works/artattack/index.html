         Artattack is a London based company that provides a social network designer for art-based e-commerce. Modelled after the 1863 Salon des Refusés,  ArtAttack provides artists an open forum to exhibit and sell their work, which in return gives collectors and enthusiasts an opportunity to discover emerging artists and collect/share their work.  We aimed to present emerging as well as established artists with the opportunity to deliver their art to a broad global audience from the moment the app is downloaded.

         The problem
         </div>
         <div class="process_text">
         The client saw a problem in the art world; young artist that just finished any art school have very limited chances to succeed.  The goal was to create a digital platform where artists could showcase themselves, and where galleries and collectors could connect with them. The idea then expanded from there.

         <p>
         To create more clear definition of what we want to build we did a market research of current competitors. We gathered data and analyzed their user experience, finding their weaknesses and their strengths. We also quickly mockuped a few user personas and flows, and looked for apps on the market that are offering similar functionalities: like uploading photos, sharing photos, creating profiles and selling products.
         </p>
         <p>
         User research helped us understand our potential users, the terminology they see, the content of their work, how they currently perform their tasks and what opportunities exist for better supporting their tasks.

         Personas

         <div class="process_text">
         User modeling begins with an in-depth analysis of patterns in the user data we elicited during user research. Based on your analysis, we can developed a set of clearly differentiated user profiles or personas that represent a few important classes of users whose goals and needs we intend our product to serve.

         <div class="process_text">
         <p>
         We wanted to validate our idea as soon as possible so we skipped creating design stories and user task flows.  After we had a clear vision of what we want to build, we found similar user and behavior patterns that can be used in our product.
         </p>
         <p>
         To be sure that the choices we made (meaning functionality) cover the needs of the target audience, I have created a couple of user scenarios based on our personas. Listed bellow are the three scenarios for 3 different types of users that we have.

         After the goals were defined it was time to create the wireframes.

         Usability and visual design help shape the product’s story. Testing it at different stages helps us to refine the story and validate the assumptions.
         </p>
         <p>
         The client uses the tool for remote usability testing with potential users to see if what we are building actually works. We created a plan of the tasks we wanted to test,  created a prototype and a discussion guide. The we run the test and made revisions to the prototype.

         Feedback provided by the test users, helped us to regroup and rework some of our wireframes to improve the user experience. The test users tried to complete typical tasks, where we measured Effectiveness, Efficiency and satisfaction.

         The app is now in the development stage. After it’s completed and available to the users, we will be able to do KPI testing and gather all the feedback to see how the app is performing. Then again we can validate and improve the user experience.
